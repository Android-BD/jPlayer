jPlayer
==================

This android music player was developed by myself as an independent side project.
The goal is to allow users to browse their music library without actually having to touch the device.
This application uses the devices's proximity sensor (if available) to detect the presence of nearby objects.
Whether you are running on a treadmill or driving a car, just wave your hand over the device's sensor to change songs.

To Do List:
- saving settings state
- search filter
- playlists

Enjoy!
